# cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a character encoding that is not
# UTF-8.
notUTF8=Manifest has a character encoding of %S. Manifests must have the utf-8 character encoding.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (badMimeType): Used when an attempt is made to validate a
# cache manifest using AppCacheUtils.jsm having a mimetype that is not

# validate a page using AppCacheUtils.jsm that has a cache manifest which
# references a URI that has a file modified after the cache manifest.
fileChangedButNotManifest=The file %S was modified after %S. Unless the text in the manifest file is changed the cached version will be used instead at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheControlNoStore): Used when an attempt is made to
