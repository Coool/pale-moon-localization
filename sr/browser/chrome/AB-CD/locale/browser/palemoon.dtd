'And so, our focus was drawn through time and space to the <em>emerging dragon</em> who would not abandon hope.<br/>
Its resilience, stubbornness and spirit unbroken, and searching for long hours to find those willing to <em>join</em> its cause.<br/>
The old nest abandoned, the death throes of the Beast ignored, and more determined than ever to find glory in the future.'>
