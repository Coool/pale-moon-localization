noManifest=The specified page has no manifest.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notUTF8): the associated cache manifest has a character
# encoding that is not UTF-8. Parameters: %S is the current encoding.
notUTF8=Manifest has a character encoding of %S. Manifests must have the utf-8 character encoding.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (badMimeType): the associated cache manifest has a
# mimetype that is not text/cache-manifest. Parameters: %S is the current
# mimetype.
badMimeType=Manifest has a mimetype of %S. Manifests must have a mimetype of text/cache-manifest.

# the resource name, %3$S is the line number, %4$S is the resource name, %5$S
# is the section name.
networkBlocksURI=NETWORK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.
fallbackBlocksURI=FALLBACK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fileChangedButNotManifest): the associated cache manifest
# references a URI that has a file modified after the cache manifest.
# Parameters: %1$S is the resource name, %2$S is the cache manifest, %3$S is
# the line number.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheControlNoStore): the specified page has a header
# preventing caching or storing information. Parameters: %1$S is the resource
# name, %2$S is the line number.
cacheControlNoStore=%1$S has cache-control set to no-store. This will prevent the application cache from storing the file at line %2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (notAvailable): the specified resource is not available.
# Parameters: %1$S is the resource name, %2$S is the line number.
notAvailable=%1$S points to a resource that is not available at line %2$S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (firstLineMustBeCacheManifest): the associated cache
# manifest has a first line that is not "CACHE MANIFEST". Parameters: %S is
# the line number.
firstLineMustBeCacheManifest=The first line of the manifest must be "CACHE MANIFEST" at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2): the associated cache
# manifest has "CACHE MANIFEST" on a line other than the first line.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where "CACHE MANIFEST" appears.
cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2="CACHE MANIFEST" is only valid on the first line but was found at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (asteriskInWrongSection2): the associated cache manifest
# has an asterisk (*) in a section other than the NETWORK section. Parameters:
# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.
asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %1$S section at line %2$S. If a line in the NETWORK section contains only a single asterisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated as if the URI was listed in the NETWORK section. Otherwise such URIs will be treated as unavailable. Other uses of the * character are prohibited.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (escapeSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a space
# in a URI. Spaces must be replaced with %20. Parameters: %S is the line
# number where this error occurs.
escapeSpaces=Spaces in URIs need to be replaced with %20 at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (slashDotDotSlashBad): the associated cache manifest has a

slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ is not a valid URI prefix at line %S.

# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
tooManyDotDotSlashes=Too many dot dot slash operators (../) at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section containing more or less than the standard two URIs
# separated by a single space. Parameters: %S is the line number where this
# error occurs.
fallbackUseSpaces=Only two URIs separated by spaces are allowed in the FALLBACK section at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackAsterisk2): the associated cache manifest has a

# section the URI is simply a path prefix. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.
fallbackAsterisk2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the FALLBACK section at line %S. URIs in the FALLBACK section simply need to match a prefix of the request URI.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (settingsBadValue): the associated cache manifest has a
# SETTINGS section containing something other than the valid "prefer-online"
# or "fast". Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (general.useragent.locale):
# This is the valid BCP 47 language tag representing your locale.
#
# In most cases, this will simply be your locale code. However, in rare cases
# (such as 'jp-JP-mac'), you may need to modify your locale code in order to
# make it a valid BCP 47 language tag. (If your locale code does not include a
# region subtag, do not include one in the language tag representing your
# locale.)

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (intl.accept_languages):
# This is a comma-separated list of valid BCP 47 language tags.
#
# Begin with the value of 'general.useragent.locale'. Next, include language
# tags for other languages that you expect most users of your locale to be
# able to speak, so that their browsing experience degrades gracefully if
# content is not available in their primary language.
#
# It is recommended that you include "en-US, en" at the end of the list as a
# last resort. However, if you know that users of your locale would prefer a
# different variety of English, or if they are not likely to understand
# English at all, you may opt to include a different English language tag, or
# to exclude English altogether.
#
# For example, the Breton [br] locale might consider including French and
# British English in their list, since those languages are commonly spoken in
# the same area as Breton:
# intl.accept_languages=br, fr-FR, fr, en-GB, en
intl.accept_languages=en-gb, en

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (font.language.group):
# This preference controls the initial setting of the language drop-down menu
# in the Content > Fonts & Colors > Advanced preference panel.

# If you are modifying the charset preferences for your locale, be sure to use
# the values from that list, not the keys. Note that these values are

# Encoding warnings and errors
EncNoDeclarationFrame=The character encoding of a framed document was not declared. The document may appear different if viewed without the document framing it.
EncNoDeclarationPlain=The character encoding of the plain text document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the file needs to be declared in the transfer protocol or file needs to use a byte order mark as an encoding signature.
EncNoDeclaration=The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must to be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.
EncLateMetaFrame=The character encoding declaration of the framed HTML document was not found when prescanning the first 1024 bytes of the file. When viewed without the document framing it, the page will reload automatically. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.

EncProtocolUnsupported=An unsupported character encoding was declared on the transfer protocol level. The declaration was ignored.
EncBomlessUtf16=Detected UTF-16-encoded Basic Latin-only text without a byte order mark and without a transfer protocol-level declaration. Encoding this content in UTF-16 is inefficient and the character encoding should have been declared in any case.
EncMetaUtf16=A meta tag was used to declare the character encoding as UTF-16. This was interpreted as an UTF-8 declaration instead.
