# LOCALIZATION NOTE: The property keys ending with ".key" are for access keys.
# Localizations may add or delete properties where the property key ends with
# ".key" as appropriate for the localization. The code that uses this data can
# deal with the absence of an access key for an item.
# 
# Make sure the keys defined here don't collide with
# charsetMenuAutodet.accesskey in charsetMenu.dtd.
#
# In the en-US version of this file, access keys are given to the following:
# * UTF-8
# * All encodings that are the fallback encoding for some locale in Firefox
# * All encodings that are the fallback encoding for some locale in IE
# * All Japanese encodings
#
# For the items whose property key does not end in ".key" and whose value
# includes "(" U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS, the "(" character is significant for
# processing by CharsetMenu.jsm. If your localization does not use ASCII
# parentheses where en-US does in this file, please file a bug to make
# CharsetMenu.jsm also recognize the delimiter your localization uses.
# (When this code was developed, all localizations appeared to use
# U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS for this purpose.)
