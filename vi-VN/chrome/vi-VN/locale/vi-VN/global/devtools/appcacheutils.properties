# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Web Console

# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in

# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best

networkBlocksURI=NETWORK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.
fallbackBlocksURI=FALLBACK section line %1$S (%2$S) prevents caching of line %3$S (%4$S) in the %5$S section.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fileChangedButNotManifest): the associated cache manifest

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (asteriskInWrongSection2): the associated cache manifest
# has an asterisk (*) in a section other than the NETWORK section. Parameters:
# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.
asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %1$S section at line %2$S. If a line in the NETWORK section contains only a single asterisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated as if the URI was listed in the NETWORK section. Otherwise such URIs will be treated as unavailable. Other uses of the * character are prohibited.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (escapeSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a space
# in a URI. Spaces must be replaced with %20. Parameters: %S is the line
# number where this error occurs.
escapeSpaces=Spaces in URIs need to be replaced with %20 at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (slashDotDotSlashBad): the associated cache manifest has a
# URI containing /../, which is invalid. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.
slashDotDotSlashBad=/../ is not a valid URI prefix at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tooManyDotDotSlashes): the associated cache manifest has
# a URI containing too many ../ operators. Too many of these operators mean
# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
tooManyDotDotSlashes=Too many dot dot slash operators (../) at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackUseSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section containing more or less than the standard two URIs
# separated by a single space. Parameters: %S is the line number where this
# error occurs.
fallbackUseSpaces=Only two URIs separated by spaces are allowed in the FALLBACK section at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (fallbackAsterisk2): the associated cache manifest has a
# FALLBACK section that attempts to use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. In this
# section the URI is simply a path prefix. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.
fallbackAsterisk2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the FALLBACK section at line %S. URIs in the FALLBACK section simply need to match a prefix of the request URI.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (settingsBadValue): the associated cache manifest has a
# SETTINGS section containing something other than the valid "prefer-online"
# or "fast". Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
settingsBadValue=The SETTINGS section may only contain a single value, "prefer-online" or "fast" at line %S.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (invalidSectionName): the associated cache manifest
# contains an invalid section name. Parameters: %1$S is the section name, %2$S
# is the line number.
