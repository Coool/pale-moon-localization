# Printing error messages.
#LOCALIZATION NOTE: Some of these messages come in pairs, one
# for printing and one for print previewing.  You can remove that
# distinction in your language by removing the entity with the _PP
# suffix; then the entity without a suffix will be used for both.
# You can also add that distinction to any of the messages that don't
# already have it by adding a new entity with a _PP suffix.
#
# For instance, if you delete PERR_GFX_PRINTER_DOC_IS_BUSY_PP, then
# the PERR_GFX_PRINTER_DOC_IS_BUSY message will be used for that error
# condition when print previewing as well as when printing.  If you
# add PERR_FAILURE_PP, then PERR_FAILURE will only be used when
# printing, and PERR_FAILURE_PP will be used under the same conditions
# when print previewing.
