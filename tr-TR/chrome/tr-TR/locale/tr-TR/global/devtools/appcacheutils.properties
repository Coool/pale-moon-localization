# LOCALIZATION NOTE (cacheManifestOnlyFirstLine2): the associated cache
# manifest has "CACHE MANIFEST" on a line other than the first line.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where "CACHE MANIFEST" appears.

# %1$S is the section name, %2$S is the line number.
asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %1$S section at line %2$S. If a line in the NETWORK section contains only a single asterisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated as if the URI was listed in the NETWORK section.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (escapeSpaces): the associated cache manifest has a space
# in a URI. Spaces must be replaced with %20. Parameters: %S is the line

# that the file would be below the root of the site, which is not possible.
# Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.

# error occurs.

# section the URI is simply a path prefix. Parameters: %S is the line number
# where this error occurs.

# SETTINGS section containing something other than the valid "prefer-online"
# or "fast". Parameters: %S is the line number where this error occurs.
