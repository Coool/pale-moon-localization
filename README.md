### Language packs for Pale Moon

This repository holds all of the langage pack files for the Pale Moon web browser.
Pale Moon can be found at http://www.palemoon.org/

This repository serves as the master version control repository for the language packs that are available for the browser.

If you want to contribute, please keep the following guidelines in mind:
* For the localization process we use collaborative platform from [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/), thanks to their generosity for providing free service to Open Source projects. Please read [introduction for new translators](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/) and [guide for online editor](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/) to understand how it works.
* Pale Moon localization project is located at https://crowdin.com/project/pale-moon. It was initially prefilled with the data from language packs for Pale Moon 26, which cover about 75% of the required for Pale Moon 27.
* As a contributor you can help in the following:
  * Suggest translations of untranslated strings
  * Suggest alternative (more suitable) translations of already translated strings
  * Vote for or against the translated strings (this is required in case you propose alternative translation)
* Do not forget to use advantage of collaboration, [the communication with other project participants](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/#communicating-with-other-project-participants) is a powerful feature to find the right answers and resolve issues. You can ask any questions in comments on CrowdIn or in [deticated thread on forum](https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=13720).
* When translation in specific language is reached 100% we need to verify all strings to finalize the work. To accomplish this task the translator need obtain special permission. You can volunteer for this job or recommend someone among the participants.
* Since Pale Moon was initially derived from the Mozilla codebase you can (or even should) use Firefox language packs (version 38 and the latest version) as a reference for translation. But don't forget to make appropriate changes in the brand names (see how it was already done in other languages).
* The browser name "Pale Moon" should always remain **untranslated**, in 2-word capitalized form. Other proper names (e.g. Moonchild Productions, Sync, etc) should remain untranslated as well.
* Please keep the tone of your translations neutral and professional. If you have a choice between formal and informal expressive form in your language, use the formal form.
* Please mind the length of your translations. Many of these strings will be used in limited spaces in the browser's user interface.
* Direct submissions or pull requests to this repository currently are not accepted.
