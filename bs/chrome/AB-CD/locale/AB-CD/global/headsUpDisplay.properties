# LOCALIZATION NOTE (networkUrlWithStatus):
#
# When the HTTP request is started only the URL of the request is printed to the
# WebConsole. As the response status of the HTTP request arrives, the URL string
# is replaced by this string (the response status can look like `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).
# The bracket is not closed to mark that this request is not done by now. As the
# request is finished (the HTTP connection is closed) this string is replaced
# by `networkUrlWithStatusAndDuration` which has a closing the braket.
#
# %1$S = URL of network request
# %2$S = response status code from the server (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (networkUrlWithStatusAndDuration):
#
# When the HTTP request is finished (the HTTP connection is closed) this string
# replaces the former `networkUrlWithStatus` string in the WebConsole.
#
# %1$S = URL of network request
# %2$S = response status code from the server (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`)
# %3$S = duration for the complete network request in milliseconds

# This string is used to display JavaScript functions that have no given name -
# they are said to be anonymous. See stacktrace.outputMessage.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (stacktrace.outputMessage):
# This string is used in the Web Console output to identify a web developer call
# to console.trace(). The stack trace of JavaScript function calls is displayed.
# In this minimal message we only show the last call.
